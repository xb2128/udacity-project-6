The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. This bar plot shows the number of people survived or died. The passengers are divided by their passenger class (1st, 2nd or 3rd) and sex(male or female).
